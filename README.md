# Predicting Opening Weekend Gross for Movies

The following undertaking aims to predict the Opening Weekend Gross Revenue earned by movies released in the U.S. Market, using Linear Regression Modeling techniques.

## Motivation

In the movie entertainment industry, the Opening Weekend is comprised of Friday, Saturday & Sunday; regardless of whether the movie is released on a Friday or not of that week. This revenue number holds a very high significance due to a multitude of factors: 

  * Gross revenue earned on a movie's ticket sales is split between the movie theatres and the studios, based on complex agreements. But overall, studios get the maximum split % (typically 50%+) in the first week; and a majority of the first week sales happens on the opening weekend. 
  * Ratings for the movie are not available or highly publicized yet. A lot of opening revenue is incumbent on successful marketing & anticipation creation. Therefore, a blockbuster opening can help recoup a good portion of the movie costs.
  * A successful opening can help garner additional media attention that can further help buoy the movie for ticket sales.
 
This makes getting a better understanding of Opening Weekend Gross along with the various factors acting in tandem with it a highly important one.

## Learning Goals & Tools Used
1. Curating datasets by oneself (Understanding possible factors that can affect target variable & acquiring custom data accordingly)
   - Webscraping using **requests, Beautiful Soup,** and **Selenium.**
   * Data Exploration & Cleaning/Preprocessing using **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**
2. Feature engineering and statistical regression modeling using **Sci-kit Learn and Statsmodel**
   * Feature interactions, scaling, and custom manipulations
   * Metrics: R<sup>2</sup>, MAE, RMSE, p-values
   * Cross-validation & Pipeline creation
   * Regularization using LASSO & Ridge
  
## Data Used

**Sources:** [Box Office Mojo](www.boxofficemojo.com), [IMDB](www.imdb.com)  

The initial list of movies is acquired from this [page](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2010/?sort=openingWeekendGross&grossesOption=totalGrosses) of Box Office Mojo. It lists the movies in a tabular fashion, by year. As part of scope control, movies released only between 2010-2019 (inclusive) in U.S. is considered. Moreover, if a movie releases earlier internationally, this is not taken into account - only their Opening Weekend in U.S. matters. Lastly, all theatrical re-releases are discarded; as they potentially have a separate set of factors influencing their performance.  

Using the list of movies obtained, each movie's individual release page is scraped for additional information. An example of a release page can be seen [here](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1265337857/).

Finally, the respective movie's [IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201607/) is scrapped to obtain Budget information, as this was found to be missing on a majority of the Box Office Mojo release pages.

## Features & Target

The following features are organized from the scraped & parsed pages:  
  - Opening Weekend Theatres  
  - Release Date  
  - Studio Name  
  - Budget  
  - MPAA  
  - Genre  
  - Franchise  
  - Brand   
These features are imputed & engineered to arrive at a more accurate prediction.

The target variable is **'Opening Weekeng Gross'**.  

Additional information that was scraped and used for ancillary purposes included Release Link, Title, Domestic Gross, Max Theatres, Domestic to Opening Gross, Studio Link, Title ID, and Running Length.  

## Results

The final model achieved a R<sup>2</sup> score of 0.73 and a mean absolute error of $6,558,159 on the hold out test set. To provide context, the mean of all values in the hold out set is  $13,201,940, with the maximum value going as high as $191,271,100.

Thus, the error is almost 50% of the mean value. Additionally, by looking at the residual graphs, the model over predicts for low value Opening Weekend Grosses & underpredicts quite a bit for huge blockbusters.   

Based on the results, the target variable could be scaled logarithmically to solve for the long tail of high values. Or possibly, it would be worth experimenting with separate models, based on binning the # of theatres the movie is getting released in on the opening weekend and/or if it is part of a franchise. 

Additionally, although **Budget** is quite an important feature, it is a proxy for other factors, such as the director, lead actor(s) & marketing spend - which play possibly plays an important role in drawing huge crowds for Opening Weekends.
